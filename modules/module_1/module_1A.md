# Module 1A: Inventory and Taxonomy Update

## Module Purpose: 
This module outlines the process of assembling a species-level inventory and updating taxonomy for a collection prior to specimen-level digitization. In preparation for digitization, this module includes the process of recuration of the specimens and transfer to archival storage, accounting for specimen spacing and future growth of collection. Key pieces of data to be acquired by this workflow include: Current Species Name and Higher Classification, Specimen Count, Biogeographic Region, Storage Location, and Space Requirements.

## Module Keywords: 
Recuration; Precuration; Taxonomic Changes; Inventory


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1|Select/prioritize material for immediate digitization.|Day-to-day decisions about which specimens/trays/drawers/vial racks/slide boxes to digitize should follow global policies and decisions made in M2A.|Institutional policy, project guidelines, active research criteria, etc.|
|T2|Note specimen damage or conservation issues that need immediate attention.|Route to conservation workflow as necessary, based on institutional policy or curatorial practices.|Institutionally specific curation guidelines.|
|T3|Inventory and Record taxonomy|count specimens, count unit trays, and number of type specimens. Record any special collections and relevant biogeographic regions. Regions may be different based on scope of collection| unit tray label maker, biogeographic region map, archival cardstock and printer, paper cutter|
|T4|Update specimen taxonomy (and related authority files) as necessary.|This step may entail preparation and insertion of new specimen-level determination labels or new tray header labels.|Publicly accessible materials, Authoritative online materials (e.g. [Plazi Treatment Bank Statistics](http://tb.plazi.org/GgServer/srsStats), [GBIF Species Name Matching Tool](https://www.gbif.org/tools/species-lookup)), Professional taxonomists, [Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogue.life/), [Terrestrial Parasite Tracker parasite name lists](https://github.com/njdowdy/tpt-taxonomy). R-package taxonomy cleaning tools: [Taxotools](https://github.com/vijaybarve/taxotools)|
|T6|Sort specimens by collecting event, geography, host, sex, etc.|Based on prioritization in T1.||
|T7|Physically reposition (re-tray) specimens for improved organization and spacing.|T6, T7, and T8 may be treated as a single, combined activity to minimize handling or depending on collection needs, these tasks may be completed upon digitization or specimen acquisition.  Note: Ensuring spacing and positioning should also be included as a curational step during specimen accession.|Trays  Drawers  Computer  Printer|
|T8|Insert institutionally and/or globally unique identifiers for specimens, trays, and/or drawers.  For previously processed type specimens, this step might include re-use of pre-existing type IDs.|The point at which unique identifiers are assigned and the identifiers placed on specimens varies by institution and is alternatively included within the imaging modules. Space availability in drawer or on pin and visibility of machine-readable identifiers are considerations. Options include:  <li>linear, 1D barcodes inserted face up or face down as bottom label on pin</li><li>2D barcodes with machine-readable portion of label exposed</li><li>2D barcodes printed both sides</li><li>RFID pChip pins</li><li>RFID tags</li><li>human-readable alphanumeric tags</li>|Institution-standard unique identifier labels|

<!--|T5|(Maybe prune out "expert ID" section or move to end) Update specimen identifications (“filed as name”) and determination labels in collection and authority files in database.|This may necessitate developing procedures for tracking determinations at the unit tray level, to include:<ul><li>enlisting the assistance of a skilled professional for making accurate determinations and related decisions</li><li>ensuring that specimens within a unit tray match the header label for that tray</li><li>ensuring that unit trays are stored in appropriate drawers</li><li>ensuring that determination labels do not become disassociated from specimens during handling</li><li>ensuring that determination labels queued for data entry are physically attached to a specimen</li><li>quarantining determination labels that lack a definite association with a specimen or group of specimens to ensure they remain unrecorded or not inaccurately recorded at data entry time</li><li>assessing whether determination labels for returned/annotated specimens apply to a single specimen or group of specimens (and creating and attaching duplicate labels for all individuals within a group, as necessary)</li><li>ensuring that determination labels for returned specimens are properly handled to ensure they do not get lost or dissociated from the referenced</li>  Potentially create machine readable unit tray labels using DataShot or other software to facilitate machine scanning and creation of database records during subsequent workflow steps.|Identification literature and resources [See](http://ecnweb.org/sites/default/files/12_Eastwood_2010.pdf)| -->
