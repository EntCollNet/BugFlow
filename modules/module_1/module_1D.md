# Module 1D: Proactive Data Capture: In Museum

## Module Purpose: 
This module outlines what data should be captured when capturing data from specimens (and associated labels or field books) in a museum, including metadata not explicitly included on labels. 

## Module Keywords: 
pre-digitization, transcription, metadata


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1|Gather representative specimens that will be digitized| Make sure to include examples of specimens that have very little data all the way up to very large amounts of data. Typically this will include very old specimens (data-poor) and very new specimens (data-rich).||
|T2|Identify typical groups of fields that are included on labels associated with specimens| Generally, these fall into "Collecting event", "Determination", and "Other".||
|T3|Identify typical fields that need to be recorded that are implied by the specimen.|This includes fields like how the specimen is prepared (DWC "[preparations](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/preparations)", number of specimens (DWC "[organismQuantity](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/organismQuantity)" or "[individualCount](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/individualCount)", DWC "[disposition](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/disposition)", etc ...||
|T4|Decide upon format, names, and controlled vocabulary of these fields|This includes deciding whether to include verbatim transcription as separate fields, whether to split out certain fields like date, time, as multiple fields, etc ...|[Darwin-Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/)|
|T5|Decide whether images will be captured from specimens or labels.|If images are not going to be captured, skip to T7.||
|T6|Decide what metadata will be captured related to images.|Consider following best practices of image metadata. Generally this includes things like who captured images, who edited images, when the images were captured, what project they are related to|[Dublin-Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)|
|T7|Gather associated para-collection materials|Find and include in your analysis any para-collection materials including field books, accession books, non-digital photographs, legacy databases.||
|T8|Identify typical fields in these materials not included on labels or implied by specimen.|Expand your field analysis to include these fields.||
|T9|Repeat tasks T4-T6 for para-collections data|Again, evaluate if images need to be taken, and what metadata to capture for such images.|[Darwin-Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/) [Dublin-Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)|
