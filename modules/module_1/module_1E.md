# Module 1E: Collections Profiling 

## Module Purpose: 
This module will go over how to engage in collections profiling, also known as standardized collection health assessment, where metadata is gathered about containers and specimens in those containers to create a picture of the collection and its health as a whole. Data typically gathered includes conservation status, processing state, container condition, label(s) condition, identification level, arrangement level, data quality, computerization level, & estimated number of specimens. This can be combined/done concurrently with [Module 1A: Inventory and Taxonomy Update](https://github.com/EntCollNet/BugFlow/blob/master/modules/module_1/module_1A.md).

## Module Keywords: 
pre-digitization, collection health, containers, conservation, levels
