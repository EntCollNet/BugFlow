# Module 5E: Capturing and Creating Biological Relationships

## Module Purpose: 
This module outlines how to create and capture data encoded in labels as sematically rich biological relationships such as "parasite of" or "host to" or "pollinator of". 

## Module Keywords: 
value-added, parsing, label data, transcription, relationship

## Brainstorming
Should be capturable by GLOBI: https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/about  
Use a controlled vocabulary.  
TPT resources here will be very useful.  
Don't "overrelate" e.g. imply that something is a pollinator of something just because it was found on that plant.
