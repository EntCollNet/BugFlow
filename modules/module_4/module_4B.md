# Module 4B: Pinned 3D specimen imaging
**THIS MODULE IS IN DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE**

## Module Purpose: 
This module is intended for capturing and storing the morphological data from a 3D scan obtained via photogrammetry or microCT methods.

## Module Keywords: 
photogrammetry, image, 3-D, microCT, specimen, segmentation, visualization


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1| Select and transport selected specimens drawer(s) to proximity of imaging station.|The workflow outlined for this module integrates steps for specimen imaging, whether for all specimens or exemplar specimens. When selecting specimens consider size, weight and shape (eg. can the specimens be imaged on a turntable while camera remains fixed or should the specimens remain fixed and the camera move around the specimen)
| Institutional imaging policy. For further information on imaging guidelines and standards, see iDigBio.|
|T2|Set aside damaged specimens for conservation workflow.|Re-route specimen to conservation workflow per conservation policy. Whether to image before conservation might depend upon the severity of the damage. Also see Module 2A|Institutional conservation policy.|
|T3|If specimens are not catalogued, transcribed, or databased, decide on whether to do so before or after imaging. Regardless, imaged specimens should be associated with a unique identifier such as a catalog number.|Exemplar high resolution imaging can be done before or after typical databasing of specimen. Generally, digitization of specimens is a different workflow than imaging specimens in high resolution, and should be thought about separately, although associating images with specimens is much easier if they already at least have an database record created with an associated unique identifier.||
