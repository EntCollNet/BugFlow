# Module 3B: Indirect Data Capture from Image of Specimen or Label 

## Module Purpose: 
This module is intended for capturing the primary label data from an image of a specimen and/or label.

## Module Keywords: 
transcription, image, label, specimen, data capture


| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1|Load image; locate label within image, if required.|Label data visible in the image represents verbatim label data.
School data technicians on particular label characteristics peculiar to the collection, including peculiarities of handwriting or frequent occurrence of cryptic notations made by major collectors, determiners, or describers represented in the collection.| Images should be stored in an accessible storage device available to all technicians.  Using a large monitor or two monitors greatly facilitates this process, allowing the data entry interface to be visible simultaneously with the image.|
|T2|Examine label data and search the database for a matching collecting event or locality record. If existing record is not found, skip to T3, else select the existing collecting event or locality record to associate with the newly created specimen record and skip to T4.|Some institutions prefer entering unique collecting event and locality data en masse as a separate workflow, beginning with the first drawer in the collection and continuing through the entire or substantial part of the collection.  Due to the redundancy of collecting events represented in many collections, this method usually results in the creation of a large percentage of the collection’s unique collecting event records from a comparatively small percentage of specimens.||
|T3|If an existing collecting event record was not found in T2, create new collecting event and locality records, using all pertinent data from the label.|If creation of collecting event and/or locality records is required here, see M4CT8.  Depending upon institutional policy, creation of collecting event and locality records might include interpolation of higher geography and related data from field notebooks, collections logs, technician knowledge, etc. See M4CT8.|Collecting event record creation protocol.|
|T4|Search for or enter barcode value or catalog number|Some institutions create provisional records during other tasks or modules, e.g. M2AT12.||
|T5|Enter remaining specimen-specific attributes into database record or spreadsheet row.|Columns should include but not be limited to:  <li>barcode (entered using an electronic scanner)</li><li>determination</li><li>date</li><li>sex</li><li>collection code</li><li>preparation type</li><li>host</li><li>ecological notes</li><li>stage</li>||
|T6|Enter links to or attach related literature or publications, field books, logs, or record-level authority sources.|||
|T7|Perform QA (M5)|||
