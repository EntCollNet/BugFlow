| TaskID | Task Name | Explanations and Comments | Resources |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
|T1| Select and transport drawer(s) to database station.|||
|T2|Select specimen for data entry.|||
|T3|Space labels on pin to make the data visible or remove label(s) from pins and arrange in pin order, top to bottom to facilitate label re-insertion.|Train data technicians on particular label characteristics peculiar to the collection, including peculiarities of handwriting or frequent occurrence of cryptic notations made by major collectors represented in the collection. For re-inserting pins into labels, turn label upside-down and flatten original hole with broad end of forceps, this allows the same hole to be reused and the label to be secure.|Find links to instructions and label forceps @mandrewj |
|T4|Add barcode label or other unique identifier label to other labels (if not previously accomplished).|Specimens should be individually and uniquely identified.||
|T5|Transcribe the writing and other information on the labels into a verbatim field(s) as much **exactly** as it appears on the label as possible.|Separating the parsing and transcription tasks allows for better quality control and verification of the content of labels in the future. If desired, these labels can be split into verbatim "Determination", "Collecting Event", and "Other" fields.|[TaxonWorks Transcription SOP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uiBeJCI5rb920o3qjYgHzTlDZPSL9_PjPoVpIOhGBI0/edit?usp=sharing)|
|T6|Record other information not indicated on labels.|Examples: number of specimens (typically one, but not always), condition of specimens, whether with associated dissections||
|T7|Save record in database with newly assigned catalog number.|||
|T8|Record who has done transcription.|This can include both transcriber and the project during which it was transcribed.||
