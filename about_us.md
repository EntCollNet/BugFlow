# About BugFlow

## History
BugFlow began in 2020 as an effort to update the insect digitization modules originally published by iDigBio in 2013. A presentation delivered to the 2020 Entomological Collections Network is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Rhvdy_b7Ic-PHJ2STMuRD0_DwM6gWQj/view?usp=sharing).
